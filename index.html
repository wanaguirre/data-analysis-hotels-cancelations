    <section id="changing-landscape" class="section">
        <p>
            The hotel booking landscape has undergone a dramatic shift, with most reservations now handled through third-party platforms like <a href="https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/study-cancelation-rate-at-40-as-otas-push-free-change-policy">Booking.com</a>. Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) have elevated cancellation policies to a central feature in their marketing strategies (<a href="https://triptease.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-free-cancellations/">source</a>). Customers have grown accustomed to flexible cancellation terms, pushing cancellation rates to nearly 40% in 2018—a 6% yearly increase since 2014 (<a href="https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/">source</a>). While appealing for travelers, this trend complicates forecasting for hotels, reducing occupancy efficiency and impacting revenue (<a href="https://www.d-edge.com/how-online-hotel-distribution-is-changing-in-europe/">source</a>).

                    <p>What if you were managing this hotel? You probably would focus on the food, room, aesthetic of the hotel, or a flashy website…, right? But have you ever thought about the silent business killer—cancellations?</p>

                    <p>Imagine you are the manager of a hotel and that one out of every three bookings you receive never materializes. Surprising, right? In our analysis, we discovered that 29% of all bookings are canceled before the guest's arrival. This high cancellation rate represents a significant challenge for hotels, affecting occupancy rates, revenue forecasting, and operational efficiency.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Financial Impact -->
    <section id="financial-impact" class="section">
        <h2>The Financial and Operational Strain of Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
            To mitigate risks, some hotels utilize services like <a href="https://triptease.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-free-cancellations/">Booking.com's "Risk Free Reservations"</a>, which transfer financial responsibility to OTAs if a canceled booking cannot be replaced. Regardless of who bears the cost, cancellations impose a financial burden across the industry. Beyond revenue losses, cancellations disrupt operations, leading to staffing inefficiencies and potentially negative guest experiences.

            In today’s review-driven economy, where <a href="https://www.stayntouch.com/blog/how-online-reviews-impact-hotel-revenue/">TripAdvisor influenced $546 billion</a> in travel spending in 2017, maintaining strong online reviews is critical. An increase in reputation scores can directly translate into higher occupancy and revenue (<a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/85353">source</a>). Accurate predictions of which bookings might be canceled are therefore invaluable for hotel operations.

                    <p><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong><br>
                    The metrics with the highest positive and negative correlations to cancellations are lead time, whether the customer is local (Portuguese) or not, average daily rate, total number of special requests, and car parking spaces. The last two have an indirect correlation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Lead Time</strong><br>
                    "Lead time" is the most highly correlated feature with cancellations. As the number of days between booking and arrival increases, customers have more time to cancel, and unforeseen circumstances are more likely to arise.</p>

                    <p><strong>Total Number of Special Requests</strong><br>
                    As the number of special requests increases, the likelihood of cancellation decreases. Engagement with the hotel prior to arrival may make customers less likely to cancel.</p>

        <h2>Leveraging Data to Improve Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Data holds the key to addressing the challenges posed by cancellations. With the right tools, hotels can segment their customer base, identify high-risk bookings, and optimize their operations. Predictive models can offer actionable insights, helping hotels prioritize resources effectively and enhance revenue by minimizing the financial impact of cancellations.

            Harnessing data analytics allows hotels to navigate the complexities of modern booking behaviors. By identifying patterns, reducing cancellations, and improving operations, hotels can foster guest satisfaction and achieve sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive market.
